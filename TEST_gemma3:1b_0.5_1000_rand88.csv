It indicates a concern about the effectiveness of the blinding strategy.","The context emphasizes the deliberate effort to maintain blinding by labeling the isotope preparations. This is a significant concern because it suggests a possible manipulation or alteration of the isotope administration process, which could lead to bias.

The absence of complete data undermines the reliability of the results and the ability to draw meaningful conclusions.","The text explicitly states that 'patient characteristics were similar but differences were found for the use of medication.' This highlights a critical gap in data – the lack of complete refill data – which directly impacts the ability to meaningfully compare the intervention groups.

This is because concealment is a crucial element of the Cochrane risk of bias assessment. The fact that subjects were randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio, with a blinding strategy, suggests a high potential for this concealment to occur.  The study design necessitates careful scrutiny of how this allocation was managed to ensure the concealment of the allocation sequence.","The context explicitly states that subjects were randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio, and the study requires a two-sided test with 80% power and a type I error of 5%. This combination of factors raises a high risk of concealment.  The detailed description of dietary intervention data collection and calculation further reinforces this concern, as the allocation sequence is a key element of the study design."
