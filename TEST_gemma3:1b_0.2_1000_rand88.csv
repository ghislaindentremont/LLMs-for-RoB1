This is a fundamental requirement for a robust clinical trial and strongly suggests a conscious effort to prevent bias in the assessment of efficacy. The inclusion of blinding further strengthens this assessment."

(13) based on a projected ovulation rate of 30% in the lifestyle/placebo arm and 55% in the combined lifestyle/metformin arm, the study required a total of 58 subjects per treatment arm to have a two-sided test having 80% power with a type i error of 5%. subjects were randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to the two treatment arms each lasting 6 mos using a computer generated random number table using permuted blocks and stratified by center and prior metformin exposure status after a baseline visit. the block schedule was blinded to the investigators and research subjects. subjects were advised to use barrier contraception and avoid pregnancy during the study in order to encourage study completion. study interventions (more complete details can be found in the supplemental text section) a combined intervention of diet and exercise was employed with the goal of achieving an average weight loss of at least 7% of initial body weight over six months with a prescription of 150 min/week of exercise combined with a low-calorie diet. (2)  dietary intervention the number of calories to maintain current body weight was assessed by combining the analysis of three day diet records obtained during screening (nutritionist v, first databank, sunnyvale, ca) with the results of the harris benedict equation multiplied by an activity factor of 1.3. the target level of calorie intake was calculated as the daily calories required to maintain weight minus 500 kcal.",HIGH,"The allocation sequence was concealed until participants were enrolled and assigned to interventions, indicating a high risk of selection bias. This is a critical concern as it means the randomization process was not truly random, potentially leading to unequal group distributions between treatment arms. The study design necessitates careful consideration of potential confounding factors introduced by the concealment.","The context explicitly states that subjects were randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to the two treatment arms each lasting 6 mos using a computer generated random number table. This suggests a lack of randomization and a potential for systematic bias. Concealing the allocation sequence until enrollment is a significant indicator of a high risk of selection bias, which can significantly impact the validity of the study results."
