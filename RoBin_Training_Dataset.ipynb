       "  'context': 'however, the nurse care managers might be expected to be invested in showing that their current provision of care was superior to between-patient support, so the most likely effect of any treatment bias would be toward the null. it is also important to note that this intervention focused exclusively on activating patients to improve their self-management. a more powerful intervention would also target provider behaviors (e.g., encourage provider medication initiation and intensification). a final limitation is the relatively low rate of uptake of the intervention. peer-based programs such as this would need to be part of a menu of options available to patients. it is also possible that with greater acceptance of novel programs such as this, uptake rates would increase. in conclusion, periodic nurse-facilitated, patient-driven group sessions supplemented with one-on-one peer-support telephone calls between age-matched partners improved glycemic control and other key outcomes more than provision of nurse care management services alone among male diabetes patients.',\n",

       "  'context': 'in osteoporotic fracture care, with the restoration of the medial hinge and intrinsic stability through anatomical reduction, implants become a load sharing rather than a load bearing construct leading to reduced mechanical failure rates. therefore, one possible explanation for the current low mechanical failure rate could be the improvement of osteoporotic fracture care in the past decade: better anatomical reduction through surgical means resulting in the restoration of intrinsic stability. in comparison to a previous study with a younger study population where anatomical reduction was achieved in 25.7% (9/35) of the patients and medial support achieved in 51.4% (18/35), the current study had a much higher rate of anatomical reduction (68.6% for the control group and 69% for the augmented group) and restoration of medial support (62.9% for the control group and 62.1% for the augmented group) [7]. this is consistent with the previous suggestion that the most important factor in determining good outcomes was good surgical techniques [7, 11, 14, 17, 49]. in addition, a hawthorne effect cannot be ruled out: given the prospective study design, the surgeons may have paid more attention to surgical details contributing to the observed lower mechanical failure rate. although it is hard to compare the ae rate of different studies due to their heterogeneity (e.g., different reporting criterion, study design, patient population, and different surgical techniques), the currently reported ae rate of 41.7% in the control group and 41.5% in the augmented group are in the upper range of previous reports [5, 9, 10, 14, 20, 22, 49]. this could be due to the prospective nature of the study and a more comprehensive collection of aes.',\n",

       "  'context': 'when used in conjunction with standard treatment such as physical therapy and lower extremity orthotics, botulinum toxin type a injections may prevent the development of fixed contractures, correct abnormal gait patterns, and even delay and/or reduce the need for surgical interventions.2 clinical guidelines now recommend that botulinum toxin type a should be offered as an effective and generally well-tolerated treatment for localized/segmental spasticity in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy.3–6  although previous studies provide evidence on the safety, tolerability and efficacy of botulinum toxin type a injections, many of these studies used reduction in spasticity and muscle tone as their main outcome measure.7 it has been widely suggested that efficacy assessments should also take into account the impact of the intervention on patient function and meaningful goals in the context of the patient’s own life.8 in the context of rehabilitation, one way to assess the functional impact of a treatment is to assess how well the treatment enables attainment of functional goals that are important to the patients and families.9 goal setting is held to be a central component of effective multidisciplinary rehabilitation practice6,10 where the treating physician or therapist engages the patient and/or their parents/guardians in a discussion of realistic goals and prioritizes the aims of treatment. in clinical practice, the goals of botulinum toxin type a therapy can vary widely for each individual patient. goal attainment scaling is a method of integrating attainment in a number of individually set goals into a single goal attainment score, such that the effectiveness of treatment can be easily compared, regardless of the goals chosen.11  we have previously reported the primary efficacy and safety results of this large international phase iii study, which showed that treatment with abobotulinumtoxina (dysport®; ipsen biopharmaceuticals, wrexham, uk) reduced muscle tone and spasticity compared to placebo in children with spasticity associated with cerebral palsy.12 in this report, we focus on the impact of abobotulinumtoxina treatment on the ability of children with dynamic foot equinus to achieve their functional goals. methods study design this was a double-blind, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose study (nct01249417), full details of which have been previously published.12 institutional review boards at the participating sites approved the protocol, and the trial was executed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and international conference on harmonization good clinical practice guidelines. in brief, this multicenter study included children (aged 2-17 years) with equinus foot positioning during stance phase of gait due to spastic cerebral palsy.13 patients were required to be ambulatory (gmfcs level i-iii) and had to have a derived modified ashworth scale score ≥2 as well as a tardieu scale spasticity grade (y) of 2 to 4 (2 = catch and release, 3 = fatigable clonus, 4 = nonfatigable clonus) and a spasticity angle [x] of ≥10° at the ankle joint of the most affected limb to be injected. patients could be botulinum toxin–naïve or previously treated, but the last botulinum toxin injection for any condition must have been >6 months prior to study entry. key exclusion criteria were a nonambulatory status, a fixed-ankle flexor myocontracture (defined by a passive range of motion angle by the tardieu scale [xv1] of ≤80° in ankle dorsiflexion), severe athetoid/dystonic movements in the targeted leg(s), a significant leg length difference (>2 cm), treatment with any medication that interferes with neuromuscular function ≤30 days prior to study treatment.',\n",

       "  'context': 'first, about 17% (n\\u2009=\\u2009182) of women were unable to receive the intervention at all because of the nurses’ heavy workload and the rapid patient turnover rate in paediatric units. by using an ‘intention to treat’ analysis, the intervention effect might have been underestimated. however, given the relatively high retention rate in this study (86% – 88% during 3, 6, and 12-month follow ups), the findings did not change much when we excluded all missing cases and re-run the analyses (data not shown here). second, the open ward setting provided an inevitable opportunity for women in the intervention and control groups to communicate with each other, and it is possible that some women in the latter group might have been exposed to part of the intervention through this way. finally, there is a possibility that some women, in either group, might have given socially desirable responses in the telephone follow-ups, since they were aware of being studied. conclusion our secondary data analyses have illustrated the important role of nurses in instructing and empowering non-smoking women, in a paediatric hospital setting, who might not otherwise have taken any action to help their husbands quit smoking. the nurses’ brief intervention has huge potential benefits especially in regions with high male smoking prevalence and low female smoking prevalence, so as to capitalize the capacity of non-smoking women in tobacco control advocacy.',\n",

      "Context: we sent letters of invitation to participate in the trial to a purposive sample of 14 of these schools and made follow-up phone calls to the school principal to explain the purpose of the study. we aimed to invite a mix of schools from affluent and deprived areas (using free school meal eligibility as a proxy measure), and of single-sex and co-educational schools (using public information [15]). only the first five schools to accept the invitation were recruited due to the scope of the study and the resources available. a stratified randomisation process (stratified by socio-economic status, and whether schools were single-sex or co-educational) was undertaken by an independent statistician to assign schools to the intervention or control group using software available at  <URL>  as the randomisation was undertaken to assess the feasibility of the randomisation process, all school characteristics were included despite the small number of participating schools. randomisation resulted in three schools allocated to the intervention group, and two schools to the control group. participants schools were asked to identify ear 9 classes (12–14-year-olds) to participate, aiming to recruit up to 50 adolescents within each school. no formal criteria were applied to class selection; however, we asked teaching staff to recruit classes that were representative of the wider school population in relation to academic ability, gender (if relevant) and perceived physical activity behaviour.\n"
